# Dr. Sabine L. Renninger

## Welcome to my homepage

I am a System Neuroscience researcher working at the intersection of molecular and optical engineering, brain-wide functional imaging and data science to uncover how neural circuits dynamically process sensory cues and adaptively compute behavioral actions.

I received my PhD from the University of Zurich, through the Neuroscience Center. I then joined the Vision to Action Lab at the Champalimaud Center for the Unknown in Lisbon where I am working on deciphering visuomotor circuit functions. 

Dedicated to learning, I had the chance to contribute to diverse neuroscience training and science outreach programs and recently complement my biological education with medical knowledge in postgraduation studies on Fundamentals of Medicine at the University of Algrave.

Beyond my passion for understanding brain and body functions I love exploring the beauty of nature in and around the ocean and local forests.
